# Person-Recognition-in-Crowded-Environments.
This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the pre-trained SSD MobileNet V2 model for efficient person recognition in crowded settings. It achieves ~95% classification accuracy, supporting applications in public safety and crowd management, with potential for further enhancements in bounding box precision and dataset coverage.
